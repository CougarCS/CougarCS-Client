			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
				CougarCS is committed to respecting the privacy of our website visitors
				in a manner that would be expected of a leading organization. We value
				our relationships with existing and prospective visitors, and recognize
				that an essential element of those relationships is the trust and
				confidence.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy applies to personal information provided or obtained
				on our websites (“Sites”), including any mobile applications that we may
				offer. This Policy does not apply to personal information that may be
				provided using the websites of our partners or any other third parties,
				even if those third-party websites are linked to our Site.
			</p>
			<h2>Information we collect</h2>
			<p>
				We may collect and store the following information when you use this
				Site:
			</p>
			<p>
				Contact and Content Upload Information. When you contact us using one of
				our online contact forms, we receive the messages you send as well as
				the personal information you provide, such as your name and email
				address. If you upload a digital photo or written content, we also
				receive any personal information you submit at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Transactional Information. We generate and collect information
				concerning our users as necessary to offer and provide services and
				merchandise, including information generated or received in connection
				with your transactions with us. This may include information that you
				provide for payment purposes, such as billing address and email address.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not store any of your payment card information. Instead, payment
				card information is encrypted and forwarded to our service provider for
				secure handling by its payment processor. We may also provide Internet
				Protocol (“IP”) address information to our service provider for fraud
				detection purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Log Data. When you access and use our Site, we may automatically record
				information concerning your activity on the Site. This may include your
				IP address or other identifier, your browser type, the types of
				information you search for and view on our Site, locale preferences, and
				your mobile carrier. If you arrived at our Site by clicking on an
				advertisement or promotion on another website, we may also take note of
				the web page you visited before you came to our Site.
			</p>
			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>
				A “cookie” is a small data file that we transfer to your browser or
				mobile device. We use cookies to collect information in order to study,
				enhance and improve the use and capabilities of our Site. We also use
				cookies to enable certain features of our Site, and to preserve your
				preferences and customize your experience when you visit and return to
				the Site. Most browsers provide controls whereby you can choose to block
				receipt of cookies, to delete cookies, or to be prompted before cookies
				are received. Please note that, if you delete or choose not to receive
				cookies from our Site, the functionality of the Site may be impaired. To
				find out more about cookies, including how to manage or delete them,
				visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third Party Advertising and Analytics. We use third-party analytics
				services to help us understand and improve the usage of our Sites and
				the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. These services may include
				but not be limited to: Google Analytics, Google DoubleClick, Adobe
				Analytics, Silverpop and ExactTarget. In some situations, we permit the
				third-party companies providing these services to set and access cookies
				(or similar data tools, such as “pixel tags” or “web beacons”) through
				our Site and our email. These companies may use your IP address or an
				anonymous identifier as well as certain information from your browser,
				together with other non-personal information about your visits to our
				Sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Geo-Location Information. Many mobile devices permit applications to
				access real-time location-based information. We may collect and use such
				information, with your consent, in order to enhance the features and
				functionality of our mobile applications and service offerings. In
				addition, some of the information we collect, such as IP addresses, may
				be used to estimate an approximate location of the device you are using
				to access our Site.
			</p>
			<h2>Online tracking/do-not-track signals</h2>
			<p>
				Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not track your activity
				across third-party websites, and we do not knowingly allow other parties
				to collect personal information about your online activities over time
				and across third-party websites when you use our Site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, various Internet browsers offer a “Do-Not-Track” option that
				uses a header to indicate a Do-Not-Track preference on the browser.
				Because the providers of Do-Not-Track and similar signals do not yet
				operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, we currently
				do not respond to those signals. For more information about
				Do-Not-Track, please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
			</p>
			<h2>How we use personal information</h2>
			<p>
				We use personal information to provide you with quality services, to
				carry out requested transactions, and to improve our Site and our
				services. We may use some of the information that we collect concerning
				you in order to present you with information concerning services that
				may be of interest, and we may share that information within our family
				of affiliates. For example, we may tailor our marketing efforts based on
				the types of services in which you demonstrate an interest, and your use
				of our Site. In addition, we may retain and use communications,
				transaction details, your IP address and identifying information in
				order to maintain audit trails for security purposes.
			</p>
			<h2>Protecting personal information</h2>
			<p>
				We are committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We
				employ reasonable security measures to secure and protect the
				information we receive. Please remember, though, that no method of
				electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure
			</p>
			<h2>Disclosure policy</h2>
			<p>
				We disclose personal information as necessary to operate, such as in
				connection with providing services to you or processing your
				transactions. We also may disclose information concerning you if
				required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary
				to comply with a legal obligation or to protect and defend our rights or
				property, or those of others. In addition, we may share anonymous
				information aggregated to reflect Site traffic volume, average time
				spent on a Site, pages viewed and other such parameters with our
				partners. We may share information with our affiliates and with
				non-affiliates as described under “How We Use Personal Information”
				above.
			</p>
			<h2>Links</h2>
			<p>
				The Site may contain links to other websites, and other websites may
				link to this Site. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
				privacy practices of such other websites. Whenever you visit another
				website—via a link from this Site or otherwise—you should review the
				privacy policy of that other website. This Privacy Policy applies solely
				to information provided or obtained on our Site.

			<h2>Your California privacy rights</h2>

				Under California&apos;s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who
				provide personal information in connection with purchasing services from
				us may make a request concerning personal information, if any, that we
				have shared with others for their own direct marketing purposes. Such a
				request may be made by sending an email message to info@cougarcs.com

				provide information as required by the California law for the previous
				calendar year concerning such other businesses and the categories of
				personal information, if any, that we have shared with them.
			</p>
			<h2>Notification of changes to policy</h2>

				the Privacy Policy from time to time to be sure you are aware of the
				most recent version. Please be assured that we will only use information
